Hi, I'm Hrsh.

I'm an ML and Computer Vision Enthusiast from Chennai, India. I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at Ashoka University occasionally dabbling in math. I am currently working as an intern at the [Mphasis Lab](https://ml2ct.ashoka.edu.in/en/) at Ashoka Univerisity.

In my free time you can find me playing Volleyball, Dungeons and Dragons (among other board games and RPGs), or practicing krav maga.
