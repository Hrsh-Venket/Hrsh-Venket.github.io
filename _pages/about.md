Hi, I'm Hrsh.

I'm currently doing my Masters in AI at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I enjoy solving problems. Most of the problems I've solved have been with Computer Vision and ML. I have experience doing remote sensing research. I'm now looking for engineering roles working on any interesting problems I can contribute to solving.

In my free time you can find me playing Board Games (Too much Terraforming Mars Lately) and the videogame TeamFight Tactics, or exercising and practicing Krav Maga.
