Hi, I'm Hrsh.

I'm an ML and Computer Vision Enthusiast from Chennai, India. I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) occasionally dabbling in math. I am currently working as an intern at the [Mphasis Lab](https://ml2ct.ashoka.edu.in/en/) and working on a Multi Camera Multi Object/Person tracking pipeline.

In my free time you can find me playing Volleyball, Dungeons and Dragons (among other board games and RPGs), and practicing krav maga.
